Why String is immutable in java?
==> When we create a string in java like String s1="Hello"; then an object will be created in string poll(Hello)and s1 will be pointing to hello.
now if we again do String s2="Hello"; then another object will be created s2 will point to hello beacuse JVM will first check if the same object is present ,
in String pool or not if not present then only a new one is created else not.

now if suppose java allows string mutable then if we change s1 to hello world then s2 value will also be hello world. so java string is immutable.  

what is the difference between String and String Builder?
==> strings are immutable but String builder make string mutable.
string builder will not create a new modified instance of the current string object but to do the modification in the exsisting string.

And Write some of the methods of String class at least 5 with example?
=> String str="priyanshu";
   String str1="example";
1. str.charAt(4)---->'a'
2.subString(2)--->"iyanshu"
3. str.indexOf('r')---> 1
4 str.toCharArray ---->["p","r","i","y","a","n","s","h","u"]
5 str.equals(str1)--->False.
