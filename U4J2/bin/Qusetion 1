Explain the difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship with the help of an
example?

IS-A relationship ->
Inheritance in java represent IS-A reationship ,which
is also known as parent child relationship.
example:
 class Animal{
 void funX(){
 System.out.print("this ia Animal calss");
 }
 }
 
 class Dog extends Animal{
 @Override
 void funX(){
 System.out.print("this ia dog calss");
 }
 }
 
 Here: Dog IS-A Animal.




HAS-A realtionship ->
 HAS-A realation is a relation between two object.
 when one class contain other class as an insatnce is called 
 HAS-A relation.
 
 example:
 
 class A{
 void funX(){
 System.out.print("this ia A calss");
 }
 }
 
 class B {

  A a1 = new A();
  
 void funX(){
 System.out.print("this ia B calss");
 }
 public static void main(String[] args){
  B b1 = new B();
 
 }
 
 2).explain about access modifiers and their accessibility?
 
 access modifier gives the accessibility of class ,methord,variable in diff packages.
 there are 4 type of access modifier.
 1).Public -> everywhere in any package.
 2).default -> act public inside same package but act private outside the package.
 3).private -> inside same class.
 4).protected ->Act as default but  can be used ouside the package because of
                inheritance.
